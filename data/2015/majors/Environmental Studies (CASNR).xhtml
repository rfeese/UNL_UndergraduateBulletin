<p class="basic-text">The environmental studies major is designed for students who want to make a difference and contribute to solving current as well as future environmental challenges on a local to global scale. Solutions to such problems as climate change, pollution, and resource conservation require individuals who have a broad-based knowledge in the natural sciences, social sciences and the humanities as well as strength in a specific discipline. The environmental studies program uses a holistic approach and a framework of sustainability. This framework recognizes the necessity of meeting current resource needs without compromising the environment and the ability of future generations to meet their needs. The environmental studies major provides students with a degree and the skills necessary to work across disciplines and to be competitive in the job market. Students will acquire a broad-based education in the physical, biological, and social sciences and develop competency in a specific discipline.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students may select a BS track through the College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources (CASNR) or a BS or BA track through the College of Arts and Sciences. The CASNR areas of emphasis are administered through the School of Natural Resources and coordinated by the CASNR Natural Resources Undergraduate Curriculum Committee.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The degree program consists of four required components:</p>
<p class="numbered-list">1. Every major must complete the set of environmental studies core courses that provide breadth in the scientific and human dimensions of environmental issues and challenges (ENVR 101, ENVR 201 and ENVR 249). In addition, students will have the opportunity to interact and work with individuals and organizations involved in environmental issues within the community (ENVR 319).</p>
<p class="numbered-list">2. Students also complete a set of general collateral course requirements in the natural sciences (biology, chemistry and physics), Earth systems, geospatial sciences, mathematics, statistics, and in the humanities and social sciences (Human Dimension). These requirements provide students the opportunity to explore Earth and Ecological Systems; understand the structure, function, and interaction among Earth’s four major spheres: land, water, living things, and air in the context of the physical, geological, and biological processes as well as human influences and their variability over space and time. These requirements also provide students with an opportunity to learn about the human dimensions of environmental challenges that involve law, politics, ethics, economics, historical setting, cultural diversity public policy, decision-making, and risk assessment at local to global scales with emphasis on environmentally sustainable development. In addition, students will use and apply relevant field, laboratory, geospatial, and social science research methods, tools and technologies to address environmental challenges in an ethical manner.</p>
<p class="numbered-list">3. After 52 hours of course work, majors are strongly encouraged to develop an individual course of study plan in collaboration with the environmental studies academic adviser and/or director that specifically defines an emphasis area that will provide depth in one of the following areas: anthropology, biology, chemistry, communication studies, english, geography, geology, meteorology-climatology, political science, psychology, or sociology (through the College of Arts and Sciences); or applied climate science, leadership and entrepreneurship, or natural resources (through the College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources).</p>
<p class="numbered-list">4. After earning 88 credit hours, students must complete a “capstone” senior thesis (ENVR 499A and ENVR 499B) with permission of the program director and under the guidance of a faculty adviser with expertise in their chosen area of emphasis.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph">The environmental studies program has a minimum 1-credit-hour internship course (ENVR 495) requirement that provides the opportunity to gain work experience in an off-campus setting related to a student’s academic and career objectives. Advanced students are encouraged to explore this possibility with the adviser in their area of emphasis and with the program director.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students interested in majoring in environmental studies through the College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources are advised to make an initial appointment with the program director or academic adviser.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students interested in obtaining a minor in environmental studies need to visit with the environmental studies academic adviser to establish a course of study plan that consists of course work relevant to student’s interests and goals.</p>

<p class="requirement-sec-1"><strong>PROGRAM EMPHASIS AREAS</strong> - <strong>Select one of the following three options:</strong></p>
<p class="requirement-sec-1"><br /><strong>Option 1.</strong> Any CASNR Minor or second major, selected in consultation with academic adviser 18 cr<br /><br />Students are strongly encouraged to add 6 additional credits at the 300 level or higher of discipline-specific courses, especially if they are considering graduate work.<br /><br /><strong>Option 2. Natural Resources 19-25</strong><br />The Natural Resources emphasis area has been designed to allow a student to tailor their course work to meet their learning and career objectives. By the end of their sophomore year, the student will work with the environmental studies academic advising team to develop an individual study plan for approval. Their plan of study must include at least 7 courses and a minimum of 19 hours of course work in natural resources courses (NRES, WATS, SOIL, RNGE). Three of the courses need to be at the 300 level or above. A rationale for the courses they have chosen as they relate to learning or career objectives will be submitted with their study plan. The plan can be changed at any time, but must receive appropriate approval.<br /><br /><strong>Option 3. Public Health 18</strong><br />The public health emphasis is a collaborative program between the Bachelor of Science in Environmental Studies (BSES) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) and the Master of Public Health (MPH) with a concentration in Environmental and Occupational Health (EOH) at the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) (http://www.unmc.edu/publichealth/programs/mphdualdegree/bses-mph.html). The program provides students in the Environmental Studies program at UNL an option to complete the undergraduate degree in Environmental Studies and the MPH in EOH in about five years. The collaborative program is designed for dedicated undergraduate students who are motivated and willing to take on the challenges and opportunities related to professional education. The collaborative BSES and MPH in EOH involves intensive study, a senior thesis, service learning, and capstone courses in EOH.<br />The collaborative program is a 147-155 credit hour undergraduate/professional option allowing eligible students to work toward the EOH concentration in the MPH program requirements while completing their undergraduate degree. Students interested in this option will work closely with their advisors to develop an integrated plan of study. The plan will cover the entire undergraduate and professional program and will be reviewed each semester with the student’s advisors. A maximum of 18 of credits from the MPH program (of the required 45 graduate credits for the MPH degree) will be counted toward the undergraduate degree. The student will receive a BS in Environmental Studies with an emphasis in Public Health and an MPH with a concentration in Environmental and Occupational Health. Students with sophomore standing and at least 45 hours of completed coursework in their undergraduate degree program may apply for admission to the collaborative BSES and MPH in EOH. See the Environmental Studies program coordinator or the UNMC graduate studies bulletin for pre-requisite and admission process details. <br /></p>
