<p class="content-box-h-1">DESCRIPTION</p>
<p><span class="basic-text">The Informatics minor is an interdisciplinary program that prepares students with core computational skill sets and competencies that allow them to solve problems within their chosen discipline or field. The program also builds interdisciplinary problem solving skills that are applicable and advantageous across academia and within industry. The minor’s objectives are anchored around a set of core outcomes, such that students completing the minor will be able to:</span></p>
<p class="list-indent">1. Apply computational thinking to solve problems effectively and implement it using a programming language;</p>
<p class="list-indent">2. Apply statistical techniques to assess outcomes of empirical studies or experiments, and set up research designs to evaluate tools, techniques or hypotheses effectively;</p>
<p class="list-indent">3. Interact, use and manage data or databases and solve data-centric problems; or organize, visualize, and communicate digital data effectively and efficiently; or use creative competencies to generate creative solutions; and</p>
<p class="list-indent">4. Contribute one’s expertise to the solution of interdisciplinary problems by effectively collaborating and communicating with those from other disciplines.</p>
